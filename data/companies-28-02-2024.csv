Dune Security,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dune-security,,,Active,For Profit,2023-05-23,"AI fighting AI. CISOs face an impossible risk landscape today.  80% of cybersecurity breaches start because of employee error.  The problem is exacerbating with generative AI, as a single hacker can specifically target thousands of employees in the same amount of time that they used to specifically target tens of employees with social engineering.  CISOs lack tools to deal with employee risk and are held accountable when a breach inevitably happens. By leveraging AI at each step, Dune Security empowers organizations to quantify individual risk through analyzing user behavior, context, learning patterns, and third party data. This allows the automation of tailored cybersecurity measures to each individual, transforming vulnerabilities into strengths. Dune is the central engine of all employee risk data, which is a solution that is not just timely for organizations but necessary in navigating the present cybersecurity landscape. This gives the CISO the capability to understand who are the high risk employees, to what extent, and why - as well as automatically remediate and restrict access to keep their organization safe. Today, Dune Security uniquely replaces legacy and ineffective security awareness training by pinpointing the crucial 8% of employees responsible for 80% of the risk, ensuring all employees receive personalized, machine learning-driven training tailored to their risk profile. CISOs also have easy access to quantifiable data via robust reporting and API-out capability, enabling them to both report to compliance auditors, regulators, and insurance underwriters, as well as restrict access to high-risk employees through other security systems.",Pre-Seed,2023-05-16,day,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cyber Security, Information Technology, SaaS","New York, New York, United States",Dune Security uses AI to pioneer Employee Security Posture Management and reduce the attack surface for every enterprise.,"20,835",2000000,USD,2000000,2000000,USD,2000000,4,"Antler, Alumni Ventures, Firestreak Ventures, Sky Dayton",1,https://dunesecurity.io,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/dune-security/,,,,,,2,1-10,"David DellaPelle, Michael Waite"

If you've ever navigated the maze of a SaaS tool and wished for a quicker way to find answers, or if you're a CSM feeling the weight of endless queries, we see you. We've been there too. We've seen time and again how important it is to service customers quickly, effectively, and accurately. Most businesses struggle to get customers everything they want and need when they ask for it. CSMs spin their wheels with data pulls, engineers that should be working on product have to come up with quick queries, and there's no time to service the long-tail of smaller customers that are all trying to gain value from your business or product. That's where the idea for Locusive was born. Our goal is to create an AI assistant that feels like a guide or concierge for your business. For users, it's about streamlining those moments of ""how do I...?"" and turning them into ""oh, that's how!"". And for the CSMs, it's about filtering out the noise, letting you focus on the deeper, more strategic aspects of your role. We're on a journey to blend technology with a bit of that human touch, making the digital space feel a tad more navigable and friendly.

HyprWin,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hyprwin,,1,Active,For Profit,,"Revolutionizing Sales with AI to Streamline Onboarding and Eliminate Non-Essential Tasks In the ever-evolving world of business, one thing remains constant: the challenges associated with the sales process. From lack of a clear value proposition, lack of an understanding of your product from a value-based approach, to not knowing what problems you’re trying to solve and how that relates to your prospect. The lack of asking your prospect good open-ended questions to find the gap, of what problems they face and how your product can help fill that gap, to unstructured onboarding and guidance, to the overwhelming amount of busy work that often doesn’t contribute to closing deals, we’ve seen sales reps, founders, and leaders struggle. At the same time, the tech industry is witnessing significant layoffs, with tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta, and Zoom considerably reducing their workforces. This industry shift has caused a surge of talented tech professionals to venture into entrepreneurship, launch their own firms, or join smaller tech firms that present substantial growth opportunities. Moreover, we’re experiencing a groundbreaking era characterized by the emergence of Generative AI, heralding an exciting new wave of technology. This transformation in the tech landscape introduces compelling advancements and opportunities. In this dynamic context, we see a unique opportunity to assist these emergent ventures and tech firms grappling with articulating their unique value propositions. That’s where HyprWin comes into play. Our next-generation sales enablement platform, powered by advanced AI, is primed to meet the needs of this rapidly evolving landscape. It leverages this new wave of technology and taps into the immense pool of talent looking to make a mark. HyprWin’s primary objective is to optimize the sales process, from prospect identification to deal closure. We leverage AI technology to create a dynamic, swift, and focused workflow that guides you efficiently in the right direction. Our focus is not to replicate CRM systems, laden with unnecessary complexities where only a small fraction of the features are truly useful. We adopt a CRM-agnostic approach and offer API connectivity, allowing you to integrate our platform with your existing CRM solution seamlessly if you choose to do so. Our roots are in the realm of microservices and laser-focused sales processes. With HyprWin, we’ve streamlined the approach, enabling startups to efficiently market their unique value propositions and maintain that crucial focus to facilitate rapid sales. We stand as a resource for individual contributors and teams eager to accelerate their processes and articulate their value in the most effective manner possible. Here’s how HyprWin addresses the common challenges and can be particularly beneficial to startups and smaller tech firms in the current climate. Structured Onboarding: In the wake of tech layoffs expanding the talent pool, startups and smaller tech firms are ideally positioned to harness the skills of these high-caliber professionals. With HyprWin’s AI-Driven Workflow, we eliminate the prolonged and complex onboarding processes, allowing you to swiftly integrate these professionals into your sales process. Our platform serves as a comprehensive workflow, designed to guide anyone looking to sell their SaaS product from prospect to close. This means that new representatives, irrespective of their experience level, can hit the ground running with HyprWin, armed with the necessary insights and tools to excel. Guidance: Our platform provides continuous guidance throughout the sales cycle. From prospecting to closing deals, HyprWin’s AI guides reps every step of the way, ensuring they never feel lost or unsure of their next move, which is particularly crucial for startups that need to move quickly and efficiently. Eliminating Busy Work: With the rise of “revenge startups” by those affected by layoffs, there’s a need to focus on what matters most - building a quality product and closing deals. HyprWin automates various time-consuming tasks, freeing up sales reps to focus on these key aspects. From updating customer records to ranking lead quality, HyprWin handles the tedious tasks so your reps can focus on building relationships and closing sales. Reducing Non-Closing Activities: HyprWin streamlines the sales process by focusing on activities that directly contribute to deal closure. Our platform promotes clear communication and goal alignment with prospects, ensuring that reps spend their time on high-impact tasks that lead to sales. With HyprWin, sales reps are empowered to focus on what they do best: selling. Our platform combines cutting-edge AI technology with an intuitive user experience, revolutionizing the way sales teams operate and helping startups and teams to navigate the current landscape of the tech industry. With the ongoing economic disruption and the surge of startups, the current market conditions create an ideal environment for new businesses to emerge. A recent survey of 1,000 laid-off tech workers conducted by Clarify Capital LLC found that 63% of the respondents started their own company after their layoff. As these new startups rise from the ashes of tech industry layoffs, HyprWin stands ready to support these bold entrepreneurs and smaller techfirms in accelerating their sales and driving their success. In the end, we believe that the key to overcoming the challenges in the sales process lies in intelligent automation, actionable insights, and effective guidance. With HyprWin, we’re making that belief a reality, one sales team at a time. HyprWin is more than just a tool - it’s a game changer for those in the sales industry. Whether you’re an individual sales rep looking to streamline your process and sell value in the best way possible, or a startup aiming to sell your unique value proposition quickly and efficiently, HyprWin is designed to support you. We are committed to helping teams and startups navigate the changing landscape of the tech industry, turning challenges into opportunities and driving success. With HyprWin, you’re not just getting a platform - you’re getting a partner in success.

Ivyngton transforms the insurance landscape with an innovative AI-enabled approach. Personalizing each policy: Everyone is unique, with distinct needs and concerns. At Ivyngton, we believe your insurance should reflect just that. Instead of providing a generic policy, our advanced 63B parameter insurance quote model is designed to understand and cater to your specific requirements. This not only ensures that you're covered for what truly matters to you but also provides us with precise insights into the risk profiles of the policies we craft for each individual. Assured insurance: We are the only insurance company which will pay your claim even if the underwriter refuses to. If your claim isn't paid by our underwriters, we step in. Our legal team fights for all unpaid claims, no matter how small, and we charge only 20% of the recovered amount. Lower risk: Instead of confusing terms and hidden fees like traditional insurance companies, we only take 30% of premiums as profit and give the remaining 70% to our underwriters. In return, these underwriters shoulder 100% of the risk. AI-categorized policies: By harnessing the power of our models, we offer underwriters precise risk categorization for millions of personalized policies. This means faster approvals, fewer denials, and more accurate pricing for customers. Transparent, accessible, and efficient: Our customer dashboard is an instant one-stop-shop for all of your policies, whether taken out by you or your employer, saving you time and stress, allowing you easy one-click claims and one-click access of all of your documents.
